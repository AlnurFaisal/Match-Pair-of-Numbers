## How the game works?

There are different levels to the game. In order to move on to the next level, you have to find all the pairs of numbers and match them. If you match the wrong pair of numbers, the game will indicate by hiding the pair of number you have selected and you have to try again. If you have successfully match a pair of number, the color on the box will turn green as an indicator that the pair of number is successfully matched. The scores are updated after every successful level completion. **One thing to take note, upon starting the game there is a grace period to allow users/players to memorize the location of the pairs before the numbers are hidden and this grace period is dependent on the level diffictlty. The harder the game gets, the longer the grace period is stretch**.
